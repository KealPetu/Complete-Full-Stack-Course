<h2>This is my top 3 best video games of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Dark Souls</h3>
<p>THe reason I got into game development, challenged me in ways no other videogame could.</p>
<h3>God Of War</h3>
<p>A true reinventio of the saga, With a greater focus on story and characters. It's nice to see an evolution
    to the once feared ghost of sparta being turned into a much more complex and rich character.

<h3>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
<p>A very beautifully constructed game, it's content rich experience is greater than i expected before.</p>
