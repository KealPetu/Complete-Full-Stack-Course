  <hr>
  <p>Hello there!, My name is Kevin Penafiel. I'm an Game Developer Wannabe, but also a pseudo Software-Engineer if you get what I mean.</p>

  <p>Currently Working os several projects like learning to use Game Engines like Unity, Unreal and even Godot!. I've always loved how the videogames through its medium could convey many emotions that other media can't.</p>

  <p>I have experience in several programming languages like: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Python</li>
  </ul>

  And now I'm currently Learning HTML/CSS and how to be a FullStack developer in General.
