    <h3>Dark Souls</h3>
    <p>The reason I got into game development, challenged me in ways no other videogame could.</p>
    <h3>God Of War</h3>
    <p>A true reinventio of the saga, With a greater focus on story and characters. It's nice to see an evolution
        to the once feared ghost of sparta being turned into a much more complex and rich character.

    <h3>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
    <p>A very beautifully constructed game, it's content rich experience is greater than i expected before.</p>
